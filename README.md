# Introduction to Programming in R

## Description:

This repository contains my coursework and practice files for the "Introduction to Programming in R" module. It showcases various foundational R programming concepts through practical examples and assignments. The scripts demonstrate a range of techniques from basic data manipulation to more complex statistical computations.

## Repository Contents:

- Calculate_mean_std.R: Functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation of datasets.
- Data_manipulation.R: Examples of data manipulation techniques including sorting, merging, and subsetting data frames.
- diagonal_el_sum.R: A script to calculate the sum of diagonal elements in a matrix.
- Fibonacci.R: Implementation of an algorithm to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
- Filter_data.R: Functions to filter datasets based on specific criteria.
- Formative_Assignment_2.R: An assignment script demonstrating applied data analysis with R.
- Mean.R: Calculation of the arithmetic mean of a numerical dataset.
- New.R: A script containing various R programming exercises.
- Occurence.R: Code to count the occurrences of elements within a vector.
- Skewness.R: Computation of the skewness of a distribution from a sample dataset.
- Variance.R: Function to calculate the variance of a dataset.
- Learning Outcomes:

Gained proficiency in basic R syntax and control structures.
Developed the ability to perform essential data preprocessing tasks in R.
Enhanced understanding of statistical functions and their implementation in R.
Acquired skills in writing efficient R code for data analysis tasks.
## Usage:

The scripts can be run in any R environment. Make sure to set the working directory to the location of the downloaded scripts before execution.
Each script is self-contained and includes comments explaining the logic behind the code.
Contribution:

While this repository primarily serves as a record of my learning progress, I welcome suggestions and discussions on best practices in R programming.
## Note:

The scripts in this repository are part of an academic coursework and are designed for educational purposes.
